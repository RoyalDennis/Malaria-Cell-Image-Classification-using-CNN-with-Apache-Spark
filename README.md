# Malaria-Cell-Image-Classification-using-CNN-with-Apache-Spark
This project focuses on classifying malaria-infected and uninfected blood cell images using a CNN implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, combined with Apache Spark. The objective is to demonstrate the potential for automated malaria screening, especially in resource-limited regions where microscope experts are not always available.
